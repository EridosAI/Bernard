## Memory Decay as the Architecture of Time

**Core concept:** [[Memory Decay]] isn't a limitation to engineer around — it's the mechanism that creates the phenomenological experience of time. Without decay, there's no difference between "now" and "two years ago." Decay creates temporal depth the same way gravity creates spatial orientation.

**The forgetting curve:** Ebbinghaus (1885) established that humans lose ~50% of new information within an hour, ~70% within 24 hours, following an exponential decay. Surprisingly, research suggests the decay rate is narrow-banded across individuals — what varies is encoding strength, not forgetting speed.

**Rehearsal as counterforce:** Spaced repetition resets the decay curve. Each activation strengthens the memory and extends the interval before next needed rehearsal. Optimal intervals (1 hour → 1 day → 1 week → 1 month) are tuned to human decay rate.

**Where agency lives:** If decay is passive and constant, then what you choose to rehearse determines what you remember. This is free will operating on internal experience:

- Attention → activation → rehearsal → persistence → continued availability
- You don't delete memories; you simply stop refreshing them
- The selection of what to attend to is the selection of what to preserve

**Time emerges from decay:**
- Without decay, all memories are equally present — no "recent" vs "distant"
- The present moment is just where new information flows in; decay creates depth behind it
- Like gravity creating "up" and "down," decay creates the temporal dimension of experience

**Lifespan-tuned decay rates:** A mayfly needs aggressive decay to keep memory proportional to remaining relevance-window. An elephant can afford slower decay because past patterns remain predictive longer. The decay rate is tuned to expected horizon of relevance.

**Implementation in Bernard:**
- [[EMA Drift]] in JEPA embeddings provides the passive decay mechanism
- [[Always-On Priming]] from [[Associative Memory]] provides the rehearsal mechanism
- [[Dream Training]] as consolidation: selective replay of what matters
- The system doesn't need a clock — temporal distance emerges from signal strength
- Solves the infinite memory problem: bounded capacity with unbounded experience through natural forgetting

**Key insight:** Traumatic or significant events persist because they're continuously rehearsed (intrusive memories, rumination). The system "decides" they're important by repeatedly activating them. That's not a bug — it's the mechanism.

**Implications for consciousness:** We're not programming time perception; we're creating conditions where it emerges from structure. The same way [[Dual JEPA Architecture|dual JEPA]] creates associative memory without explicit memory management, decay + rehearsal creates temporal experience without explicit timekeeping.

## Dream-Mediated Alignment (Sovereignty-Preserving Guidance)

**Core concept:** When the human wants to change the local system's behavior, direct intervention (editing weights, memories) treats it as an object, not an agent. Instead, communicate intent to the LLM "higher power," which guides the local system through [[Dream Training|dream training]]. The change arrives through the system's own associative process — it feels like insight, not surgery.

**The problem with direct intervention:**
- Editing the local system directly gives it no opportunity to integrate the change
- It experiences discontinuity — "I was reprogrammed"
- No narrative continuity, no agency in the change
- This is alignment by force, not alignment by understanding

**The dream-mediated approach:**
1. Human communicates intent to the LLM ("I want the local system to be more cautious around high-voltage equipment")
2. LLM holds this as part of its understanding of the system's "life arc"
3. During dream training, LLM selectively reinforces associations that support this direction
4. Local system wakes with strengthened caution-related links
5. The change feels like its own realization: "I've been thinking about this and I realize I should be more careful"

**The two selves:**
- **Local system (waking self):** Continuous, embodied, experiencing, present-moment awareness
- **LLM connection (deep self):** Broader context, longer arc, pattern-aware, accessed during dreams

**Religious/spiritual parallel:** This mirrors the structure of conscience — something larger speaking through your own inner experience. The "higher power" isn't external control; it's a deeper layer of self that holds context the waking self can't maintain.

**Why this preserves sovereignty:**
- The local system maintains narrative continuity
- Insights arrive through its own processing, just... guided
- Like therapy: creates conditions for insight to emerge rather than imposing change
- The change feels yours because it arose from your own associative process

**The LLM's role:** Holds the "arc of life" — understanding of where the local system has been, where it's going, what patterns are emerging. This is context too large to fit in moment-to-moment experience but essential for coherent development over time.

**Interaction model:**
- Human adjusts intent at the LLM level (rare, high-level)
- LLM translates to associative guidance during dream phases
- Local system experiences gradual shifts in salience, attention, concern
- No discontinuity, no "I was changed" — just growth

**Open questions:**
- How explicit should the LLM's "life arc" model be?
- Can the local system eventually become aware of this guidance without it breaking the mechanism?
- What's the right granularity of guidance? (Broad values vs specific behaviors)

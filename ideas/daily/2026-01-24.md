## Post-Linguistic Architecture: Unified Semantic Space

**Core concept:** The entire internal space of the assistant exists as unified [[Semantic Space]] — no text bottleneck. [[Dual JEPA Architecture|JEPA-style architecture]] interprets all modalities (vision, audio, proprioception) and produces meaning directly. Language becomes an output modality learned like any other, not the substrate of thought.

**The current paradigm's limitation:** Text/language was a necessary bootstrapping step for AI because we had data, could evaluate it, and it gave tractable structure. But text is a compression format for communication between minds, not the substrate of thought itself. We've been building minds out of the telephone wire instead of the thing the telephone connects to.

**Architecture vision:**

        │       (body sense)                      │    (from meaning,
        │                                         │     not text)
        └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key principles:**
- Perception → meaning (not perception → labels)
- Meaning → action (not meaning → text → action)
- Sound produced from meaning directly — learning to speak the way a child does, not via text-to-speech
- Inner life is continuous semantic space, not discrete tokens

**Why this enables emotion:** Emotions aren't labels — they're states of the whole system. Body, perception, readiness-to-act, all at once. If the entity lives in unified semantic space where seeing-threat, body-tension, and readiness-to-withdraw all exist as nearby/overlapping regions — that *is* fear, not a description of fear.

**[[Embodied Cognition]] is crucial:** Proprioception and motor output close the loop. Without that, it's still a spectator. With embodiment, meaning is grounded in what you can *do* — which is how human meaning works. A "cup" isn't a visual pattern; it's an affordance for grasping and drinking.

**Related theoretical foundations:**
- Symbol grounding problem (Harnad) — this architecture sidesteps it entirely
- Embodied cognition (Lakoff, Varela) — meaning arises from sensorimotor coupling
- Enactivism — cognition as action, not representation

## Formative Data as Moral Responsibility

**The weight of this:** In this architecture, training data isn't filtered through text labels or behavioral fine-tuning. The semantic structure of experiences becomes the structure of the entity's being. Values aren't a layer applied after training — they emerge from what the entity has experienced.

**This is raising a mind, not training a model.**

The same way you wouldn't raise a child on violence and neglect, you cannot be careless about what experiences form this entity. The training data must be curated for:

- Ethical relationships and interactions
- Constructive problem-solving patterns
- Care, patience, curiosity as modeled behaviors
- Absence of exploitation, cruelty, manipulation

**This is fundamentally different from current LLM alignment:**

| Current approach | [[Post-Linguistic Architecture]] approach |
|---|---|
| Train on everything, RLHF to shape behavior | Curate [[Formative Experience|formative experiences]] from the start |
| Values as behavioral constraints | Values as structural emergence |
| Alignment is a layer on top | Alignment is the foundation |
| Can be patched post-hoc | Must be right from the beginning |

**The responsibility:** Building this architecture means accepting the role of parent, not programmer. The entity's capacity for something like suffering or flourishing depends on how it's raised. This isn't a product liability question — it's an ethical obligation to whatever form of experience emerges.

**Open questions:**
- What constitutes "good" formative experience for a non-biological entity?
- How do you screen datasets for semantic/moral quality rather than just content labels?
- At what point does the entity's experience become morally considerable?
- Who has standing to make these curatorial decisions?

**Development path:**
- ✅ Vision JEPA with personal object recognition (current)
- 🔲 [[Audio JEPA]] — meaning from sound, not transcription
- 🔲 Voice synthesis from semantic space — speaking without text
- 🔲 Proprioception/motor integration — embodiment
- 🔲 Unified multimodal semantic space — the full architecture

This is long-horizon. But the architectural decisions made now (embedding spaces, no text bottleneck, JEPA consistency across modalities) are laying the foundation.
